## Economic Activity Indices:

**GDP (Gross Domestic Product):**

* GDP is the total monetary value of all final goods and services produced within a country in a given period (usually a quarter or a year). 
* It serves as a primary indicator of a country's economic health and overall size. 

**Consumer Price Index (CPI):** Measures inflation by tracking the average price changes of a basket of goods and services

**Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI):** Surveys purchasing managers in various sectors to gauge business activity and economic growth

### Definitions

**YoY Growth (Year-over-Year Growth):**

* YoY growth refers to the percentage change in a metric (like GDP) compared to the same period in the previous year. 
* It helps assess the growth rate of an economy and identify trends over time.

**Short-Term Rates:**

* Short-term interest rates are the interest rates charged on loans that mature within a relatively short period (typically less than a year). 
* Examples include federal funds rates, Treasury bill rates, and commercial paper rates.
* Central banks, like the Federal Reserve in the US, often use short-term rates as a monetary policy tool to influence economic activity.

**Long-Term Rates:**

* Long-term interest rates are the interest rates charged on loans that mature over a longer period (typically more than a year). 
* Examples include Treasury bond rates, mortgage rates, and corporate bond rates.
* Long-term rates are influenced by various factors like inflation expectations, economic growth outlook, and risk perceptions.

**Inverted Yield Curve:**

* An inverted yield curve occurs when short-term interest rates are higher than long-term interest rates for similar maturities. 
* This is an unusual situation and is often seen as a potential warning sign for a future economic slowdown or recession.
* The rationale is that investors typically demand a higher premium for holding long-term debt during uncertain economic times, leading to a flattening or inversion of the yield curve. 

> Overall, an inverted yield curve is a noteworthy signal that shouldn't be ignored. It's a sign for policymakers, businesses, and investors to monitor the economic situation closely and adjust their strategies accordingly.

**Codes:**

The codes we explored focus on two specific interest rate series from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) database:

* DGS2: This code represents the Treasury Constant Maturity Rate for a security with a maturity of 2 years. In other words, it's the interest rate the US government pays to borrow money for a 2-year period.
* DGS10: This code represents the Treasury Constant Maturity Rate for a security with a maturity of 10 years. It reflects the interest rate for a 10-year US government bond.

## Stock Market Indices:

**S&P 500:**

The S&P 500 (Standard & Poor's 500) is a stock market index that tracks the performance of 500 large-cap companies listed on stock exchanges in the United States. It's considered a leading indicator of the overall U.S. stock market health.

**Nasdaq Composite (US):** Tracks all companies listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market

**Dow Jones Industrial Average (US):** Tracks 30 large, blue-chip companies in the US
> Blue-chip companies in the US are well-established, financially sound, and large-capitalization (large market value) corporations

**IPC Mexico:**

The IPC Mexico (√çndice de Precios y Cotizaciones) is a stock market index that tracks the performance of the 35 largest and most liquid stocks listed on the Bolsa Mexicana de Valores (BMV), the main stock exchange in Mexico. It serves as a benchmark for the Mexican stock market.
