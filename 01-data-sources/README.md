# Financial Data Sources

## Economic Activity Indices:

**GDP (Gross Domestic Product):**

* GDP is the total monetary value of all final goods and services produced within a country in a given period (usually a quarter or a year). 
* It serves as a primary indicator of a country's economic health and overall size. 

**Consumer Price Index (CPI):** Measures inflation by tracking the average price changes of a basket of goods and services

**Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI):** Surveys purchasing managers in various sectors to gauge business activity and economic growth

### Definitions

**YoY Growth (Year-over-Year Growth):**

* YoY growth refers to the percentage change in a metric (like GDP) compared to the same period in the previous year. 
* It helps assess the growth rate of an economy and identify trends over time.

**Short-Term Rates:**

* Short-term interest rates are the interest rates charged on loans that mature within a relatively short period (typically less than a year). 
* Examples include federal funds rates, Treasury bill rates, and commercial paper rates.
* Central banks, like the Federal Reserve in the US, often use short-term rates as a monetary policy tool to influence economic activity.

**Long-Term Rates:**

* Long-term interest rates are the interest rates charged on loans that mature over a longer period (typically more than a year). 
* Examples include Treasury bond rates, mortgage rates, and corporate bond rates.
* Long-term rates are influenced by various factors like inflation expectations, economic growth outlook, and risk perceptions.

**Inverted Yield Curve:**

* An inverted yield curve occurs when short-term interest rates are higher than long-term interest rates for similar maturities. 
* This is an unusual situation and is often seen as a potential warning sign for a future economic slowdown or recession.
* The rationale is that investors typically demand a higher premium for holding long-term debt during uncertain economic times, leading to a flattening or inversion of the yield curve. 

> Overall, an inverted yield curve is a noteworthy signal that shouldn't be ignored. It's a sign for policymakers, businesses, and investors to monitor the economic situation closely and adjust their strategies accordingly.

**Codes:**

The codes we explored focus on two specific interest rate series from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) database:

* DGS2: This code represents the Treasury Constant Maturity Rate for a security with a maturity of 2 years. In other words, it's the interest rate the US government pays to borrow money for a 2-year period.
* DGS10: This code represents the Treasury Constant Maturity Rate for a security with a maturity of 10 years. It reflects the interest rate for a 10-year US government bond.

## Stock Market Indices:

**S&P 500:**

The S&P 500 (Standard & Poor's 500) is a stock market index that tracks the performance of 500 large-cap companies listed on stock exchanges in the United States. It's considered a leading indicator of the overall U.S. stock market health.

**Nasdaq Composite (US):** Tracks all companies listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market

**Dow Jones Industrial Average (US):** Tracks 30 large, blue-chip companies in the US
> Blue-chip companies in the US are well-established, financially sound, and large-capitalization (large market value) corporations

**IPC Mexico:**

The IPC Mexico (√çndice de Precios y Cotizaciones) is a stock market index that tracks the performance of the 35 largest and most liquid stocks listed on the Bolsa Mexicana de Valores (BMV), the main stock exchange in Mexico. It serves as a benchmark for the Mexican stock market.

## Important Metrics

Dividend yield and growth rate are **critical metrics** for analyzing dividend-paying stocks.  

* **Dividend Yield:** This metric reflects the percentage return you receive on your investment based on the annual dividend payout per share relative to the current stock price. It's a good starting point for identifying income-generating potential.
* **Dividend Growth Rate:** This measures the year-over-year increase in the dividend amount per share. A consistent or rising growth rate suggests a company's commitment to rewarding shareholders and potentially signals financial stability.
* **Payout Ratio:** This ratio indicates the portion of a company's net income that's distributed as dividends. While a higher payout ratio suggests more income for shareholders, it can also limit resources for company growth. A sustainable payout ratio is ideal.
* **Earnings Per Share (EPS):** This metric represents a company's profit attributable to each common share outstanding. It helps assess a company's profitability and its ability to maintain dividend payments in the future.
* **Price-to-Earnings Ratio (P/E Ratio):** This ratio compares a company's stock price to its EPS. A lower P/E ratio might suggest a potentially undervalued stock, especially if the company offers a healthy dividend yield.

**Valuable Time Series:**

* **Historical Dividend History:** Analyzing historical dividend payments over several years can reveal trends in payouts, growth rates, and potential periods of suspension or reduction. This can provide insights into the company's dividend policy and its commitment to shareholder rewards.
* **Stock Price Chart:** Visualizing the stock price alongside the dividend payments can help identify correlations between price movements and dividend announcements. This can reveal patterns and potential buying or selling opportunities.
* **Analyst Ratings and Recommendations:** Examining analyst ratings and recommendations can provide insights into the future outlook for the company's dividend policy and overall financial health. While not a guarantee, analyst opinions can offer valuable perspectives on the company's prospects.

**Additional Considerations:**

* **Company Sector and Industry:** Dividend-paying stocks are more common in certain sectors like utilities or consumer staples. Comparing metrics and trends within the same industry can be more meaningful as companies within a sector often share similar characteristics.
* **Company Size and Maturity:** Larger, more established companies might be more reliable dividend payers compared to smaller, high-growth companies that might prioritize reinvesting profits for future expansion.
* **Overall Investment Strategy:** Consider your investment goals and risk tolerance. Dividend-paying stocks can provide a steady income stream but might have lower overall growth potential compared to non-dividend-paying growth stocks. 

By analyzing these metrics and time series in conjunction with the dividend yield, you can build a more comprehensive picture of a company's suitability for your investment portfolio, considering both income generation and potential for future growth.
