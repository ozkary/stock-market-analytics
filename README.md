**Project Structure:**

The project is organized into five sections, each with its own notebook(s):

  1. **Data Sources (01-data-sources):** This section explores various data sources for historical and real-time stock market data. It will discuss APIs, financial data providers, and potential data manipulation techniques. 
  2. **Analysis (02-analysis):** This section focuses on analyzing the collected data. It will cover techniques like calculating returns, volatility, correlations, and potentially using visualization libraries like Matplotlib or Seaborn.
  3. **Modeling (03-modeling):** This section dives into building models for stock price prediction or market behavior. It can explore various models like linear regression, ARIMA, or machine learning algorithms.
  4. **Trading Strategy (04-trading-strategy):** This section explores developing potential trading strategies based on the analysis and models. Backtesting techniques may be implemented to evaluate the strategies' effectiveness.
  5. **Operations (05-operations):** This section may cover aspects like automating data retrieval, model training, and strategy execution. It could involve scheduling tools or cloud platforms for deployments.



**Documentation:**

Each notebook will be documented with clear explanations of the code and analysis steps. Comments and markdown cells will be used to explain the purpose of each code block and the insights gained from the analysis.
